This work proposes a pipeline for automatically selecting of ten interpretable multivariate anomaly detectors, called MuMSAD, as illustrated below. 
![Pipeline](./assets/pipeline.PNG)

The framework can be used in a wide range of applications, especially in root cause analysis. We have demonstrated the usefulness and practicability of MuMSAD in two real-world applications, requested by many of industrial and research collaborators.
- Automatic multi-parameter marine data quality control (see the figure below for the general overview of how anomalies identified in multi-parameter marine time series and related root cause analysis)
- Automatic identification of malfunctioning sensors in Remotely Operated Vehicles.

## Installation

To install MSAD from source, you will need the following tools:

- `git`
- `conda` (anaconda or miniconda)

#### Steps for installation

**Step 1:** Clone this repository using `git` and change into its root directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntnguyen-so/MuMSAD_framework.git
cd MuMSAD_framework/
```

**Step 2:** Create and activate a `conda` environment named `MSAD`.

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate MuMSAD
```

> Note: If you plan to use GPU acceleration, please ensure that you have CUDA installed. You can refer to the [CUDA installation instructions](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for guidance.

If you do not wish to create the `conda` environment, you can install only the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4.** :clap: Installation complete! :clap:

## Usage

Below, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to use our work. This includes the commands required to run the scripts along with a small explanation of what they do and the parameters they use. The values of the parameters in the scripts are just examples, and you can experiment with different values.

#### Compute Oracle

The Oracle (shown in white in the results figure at the end) is a hypothetical model that simulates the accuracy of a model on a given benchmark and evaluates its anomaly detection ability. You can simulate Oracle with different accuracy values, ranging from 1 (always selecting the best detector for a time series) to zero (always selecting a wrong detector). Additionally, you can simulate Oracle with different modes of randomness, namely:

1. **true**: When wrong, randomly select another detector.
2. **lucky**: When wrong, always select the second best detector (upper bound).
3. **unlucky**: When wrong, always select the worst detector (lower bound).
4. **best-k**: When wrong, always select the k-th best detector (e.g., best-2 is lucky).

To compute Oracle, run the following command:

```bash
python3 run_oracle.py --path=data/TSB/metrics/ --acc=1 --randomness=true
```

- path: Path to metrics (the results will be saved here).
- acc: The accuracy that you want to simulate (a float between 0 and 1).
- randomness: The randomness mode that you want to simulate (see possible modes above).

> The results are saved in _/MSAD/data/TSB/metrics/TRUE_ORACLE-100/_ (the name of the last folder should change depending on the parameters).

#### Compute Averaging Ensemble

The Averaging Ensemble, or Avg Ens (in orange in the results figure at the end), is used to ensemble the anomaly scores produced by all the detectors, by computing their average. Subsequently, the AUC-PR and the VUS-PR metrics are computed for the resulting score.

To compute Avg Ens, run the following command:

```bash
python3 run_avg_ens.py --n_jobs=16
```

- n_jobs: The number of threads to use for parallel computation (specify an appropriate value).

> This process may take some time :smile: (~16 mins in 16 cores and 32GB of RAM). The script will perform the following tasks:
>
> 1. Load all datasets from the TSB benchmark
> 2. Load all the scores for each time series and detector (~ 1800 \* 12 scores)
> 3. Compute the average score for each time series for 4 metrics (AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, VUS-ROC, VUS-PR)
> 4. Save the results in _/MuMSAD_framework/data/TSB/metrics/AVG_ENS/_.

#### Data Preprocessing

Our models have been implemented to work with fixed-size inputs. Thus, before running any models, we first divide every time series in the TSB benchmark into windows. Note that you can add your own time series here and divide them into windows, but make sure to follow the same format.

To produce a windowed dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python3 create_windows_dataset.py --save_dir=data/ --path=data/TSB/data/ --metric_path=data/TSB/metrics/ --window_size=512 --metric=AUC_PR
```

- save_dir: Path to save the dataset.
- path: Path of the dataset to divide into windows.
- metric_path: Path to the metrics of the dataset provided (to produce the labels).
- window_size: Window size (if the window size is larger than the time series' length, that time series is skipped).
- metric: Metric to use for producing the labels (AUC-PR, VUS-PR, AUC-ROC, VUS-ROC).

The feature-based methods require a set of features to be computed first, turning the time series into tabular data. To achieve this, we use the TSFresh module, which computes a predefined set of features.

To compute the set of features for a segmented dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python3 generate_features.py --path=data/TSB_512/
```

- path: Path to the dataset for computing the features (the dataset should be segmented first into windows; see the command above). The resulting dataset is saved in the same directory (**MANDATORY**).

> Note: This process is memory-intensive, and we required a minimum of 512GB of RAM to run it. If you encounter memory issues, optimizing the TSFresh library is not within the scope of this project.

#### Deep Learning Architectures

To train a model, run the following command:

```bash
python3 train_deep_model.py --path=data/TSB_512/ --split=0.7 --file=experiments/supervised_splits/split_TSB_512.csv --model=resnet --params=models/configuration/resnet_default.json --batch=256 --epochs=10 --eval-true

## Model Selection Pipeline

We propose a benchmark and an evaluation of 16 time series classifiers used as model selection methods (with 12 anomaly detectors to be selected) applied on 16 datasets from different domains. Our pipeline can be summarized in the following figure.

### Anomaly Detectors

We use 12 anomaly detection methods proposed for univariate time series. the following table lists and describes the methods considered:

| Anomaly Detection Method                  |                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                     |

| The Local Outlier Factor (LOF)            |                                                                  This method computes the ratio of the neighboring density to the local density.                                                                   |

| Principal Component Analysis (PCA)        |                              This method projects data to a lower-dimensional hyperplane, and data points with a significant distance from this plane can be identified as outliers.                               |
| Autoencoder (AE)                          |                        This method projects data to the lower-dimensional latent space and reconstructs the data, and outliers are expected to have more evident reconstruction deviation.                         |
| LSTM-AD                                   | This method build a non-linear relationship between current and previous time series (using Long-Short-Term-Memory cells), and the outliers are detected by the deviation between the predicted and actual values. |
| Polynomial Approximation (POLY)           |   This method build a non-linear relationship between current and previous time series (using polynomial decomposition), and the outliers are detected by the deviation between the predicted and actual values.   |
